# Sloffies - Parametric slides
Sloffies is an Afrikaans nickname for slides and flip-flops.

I have designed Sloffies to be parametric so anyone can customize them for their feet. 
You are able to customize the strap’s width, length, and thickness and add a logo. 
You are able to customize the sole's width, length, and thickness; add a patch; add a logo; and choose from five available sole patterns, which you can further customize to your liking.

I designed it to work with the customizer on MakerWorld, for the best user experience I would recommend using that.

You can find the model on MakerWorld: [Sloffies - Parametric slides](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1630149-sloffies-parametric-slides#profileId-1721631).

The OpenSCAD script is Open Source you are free to remix, adapt, and build on the existing design.
